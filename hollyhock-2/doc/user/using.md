# Using add-on software with your fx-CP400

After you've [patched](patching.md) your calculator's firmware (and copied the launcher), it's easy to run add-on software.

Simply take the `.hhk` file of the add-on, and place it into the root directory of your calculator's flash memory. Open the launcher (currently in the System app, accessed through the System > Imaginary Unit menu) and select the application you wish to launch from the list.

Tap 'Run' to launch the application.
