### Specs of fx-CP400 (Classpad II)

### Serial Communication 
  * TX (Transmit): this pin sends data out of calc 
  * RX (Receive): this pin receives data in to the calc
  * GND: Common electrical reference point (0 Volts) 
    - When connected to the ESP32, TX pin connects to the calcs RX pin and vice versa, and obv grounds need to connect

Ok, so with hollyhock we can send and receive serial data via [serial](https://github.com/SnailMath/hollyhock-2/blob/master/sdk/include/sdk/os/serial.hpp)

# REMEMBER 
```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph Calculator
        Calc_TX[TX Pin]
        Calc_RX[RX Pin]
        Calc_GND[GND]
    end
    subgraph ESP32
        ESP32_TX[TX Pin]
        ESP32_RX[RX Pin]
        ESP32_GND[GND]
    end
    Calc_TX -- "Data from Calculator" --> ESP32_RX
    ESP32_TX -- "Data from ESP32" --> Calc_RX

    Calc_GND --- ESP32_GND
```

#### *WTH IS Baudrate?*
* The baudrate for the calc is 115,200, meaning it can send 115,200 bits per second. **Meaning roughly 11,520 chars per second; each character is 8bits**

#### What voltage is *refresher* ðŸ˜­
* analogously electrical pressure

### Core serial functions in hollyhock
Luckily in our luck, hollyhock has done our dirty work - the low level stuff, which is perfect; dont know what id do otherwise haha
* [serial.hpp](hollyhock-2/sdk/include/sdk/os/serial.hpp) Look at [Notes](notes/SpoonFedBasicSerialControl.md) for ai slop documentation; still useful tho


### More serial info of calc
So the ESP32 operates on 3.3V, and confirmed by @that.snail, the fx-CP400 alson operates on 3.3V!!
this is great that means they are directly compatible, and there is no need for a logic level shifter, which is more complexity i dont need!

$GND_{ESP32} = GND_{Classpad}$

### Started material list. For tmwr and on,

Impulsively bought.. oh wellll
